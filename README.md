# Python Stats

This collection of programs perform various statistical tasks, including:
* calculating the __variance__ and __standard deviation__ of a set of numbers.
* calculating the __interquartile range__ of a set of numbers.

These are standard statistical tasks, so there are no doubt built-in methods for doing this. However, I want to do my own calculations so that I understand what's going on and will be better placed to assess the results of in-built methods.
